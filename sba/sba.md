# SBA 308A — JavaScript Web Application

> **Version 1.0** · 08/18/23

---

## Introduction

This assessment measures your capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner. You have **creative freedom** in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

> ⏰ **Duration:** Two (2) days (including weekends and holidays).
> This assessment will be due at **5:00pm on the second day** after it is assigned. Your instructor may provide class time to work on the assessment, schedule permitting.

## Objectives

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and `async`/`await` syntax.
- Use `fetch` and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

## Instructions

You will create a small **single-page web application**. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you — **be creative!**

### General Guidance

- **Keep things simple.** Finish the absolute minimum requirements first, then add features if time allows.
- **Approach design through the user's perspective.** User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design.
- **Choose your API first and carefully.** The API's content will largely determine your application's content.

### API Resources

You will need access to an **external API** to complete the requirements below.

- 🔗 [List of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- ⭐ Recommended: [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) and [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) — both contain all necessary features.
- You are **not limited** to these APIs. Get creative!

## Requirements

The requirements listed here are **absolute minimums**. Ensure your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.

> Create your application locally, initialize a local git repo, make frequent commits. When complete, push to GitHub and submit the link.

| Requirement | Weight |
|-------------|--------|
| Use the **fetch API or Axios** to communicate with an external web API. Use the data to populate your application's content and features. | **20%** |
| Create **user interaction** with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This should use **GET requests** to retrieve associated data. | **15%** |
| Enable **user manipulation** of data within the API through **POST, PUT, or PATCH** requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this before beginning. | **15%** |
| Make use of **Promises and `async`/`await` syntax** as appropriate. | **15%** |
| Organize your JavaScript code into **at least three (3) different module files**, and import functions and data across files as necessary. | **3%** |
| Ensure the program runs as expected, **without undesired behavior** caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls handled out of order, etc.). | **5%** |
| Create an **engaging user experience** through the use of HTML and CSS. | **5%** |
| Ensure the program **runs without errors** (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers — you can still receive partial credit). | **10%** |
| **Commit frequently** to the git repository. | **5%** |
| Include a **README file** that contains a description of your application. | **2%** |
| Level of effort displayed in **creativity, presentation, and user experience**. | **5%** |

## Reflection (Optional)

Once you have completed your project, answer the following questions:

1. **What could you have done differently during the planning stages** of your project to make the execution easier?

2. **Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement?** What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

3. **What would you add to, or change about your application** if given more time?

4. **Notes for your future self** about anything important to remember about this process.
